NAME:	Ball Bearing Reliability Data
TYPE:	Sample
SIZE:	210 records by 11 variables

DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
Each record contains the results of a test of a set of ball bearings. 
The quantities L10 and L50 are estimated percentiles of the fatigue 
failure distribution (obtained by fitting a Weibull distribution to 
the fatigue failure times, separately in each set). The objective is 
to analyse ln(L10) (and separately ln(L50)) by linear regression on 
the logarithms of P, Z and D, which are characteristics of the ball 
bearings. Differences between companies and between types of bearing 
can be tested.
